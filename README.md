Basically a rip off of BukkitScreenshotter but written in kotlin and wasn't made 18million years ago (I didn't actually initialize anything in  DefaultModelRegistry#initialize() so it probably won't render anything, if you want you can register the model manually , all the blocks are in  the Blocks enum class!!!).
